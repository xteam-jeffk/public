### My style

I am a person who works well alone, as well as with others. Ideally, I'd like to be part of a team that allows for independence in regards to project tasks, but still connected socially - through Slack or text or occasional video calls. I have grown very fond of the kanban board over the years, and enjoy the organization of projects in that manner.

### What I value

I value a social team - I'm always up for talking abuot nonsense. However, I totally value management that are hands-off.

### What I don’t have patience for

Though I try my best to accommodate everyone, I feel that I don't have patience for complex questions. Break it down piece-by-piece for me, please!

### How to best communicate with me

Slack. It gives me time to elaborate on my answers.

### How to help me

The best things for me are documentation, with `code` examples.

### What people misunderstand about me

I rarely have bad moods, but I am sarcastic and direct. In my past, there have been a very few number of occasions in which people thought I was being harsh to them, but I was simply being direct. I am not rude, but if I tell you to do something a certain way, it's definitely with merit.
